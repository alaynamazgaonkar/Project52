<p><i>Ineteresting facts about pigeons</i>
<br>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear
 distant storms and volcanoes.
<br> Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are significant transmitters of disease.
<br>   Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000bc.</p>

<p><i>Ineteresting facts about bears</i>
<br>Bears have excellent senses of smell, sight and hearing. They can smell food, cubs, a mate or predators from miles away. Their great eyesight allows them to detect when fruits are ripe.
<br> Some species of Asiatic bear build nests in the trees. They can use these for hiding, eating and even sleeping.
<br> Bears care deeply about family members. They will risk their lives and even fight to the death in order to save a cub or sibling from danger.</p>

 </div>
<p><i>Ineteresting facts about flying cicadas</i>
<br> Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the
 ground and start digging.
    <br>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.
<br>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</p>
